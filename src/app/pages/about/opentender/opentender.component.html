			<div class="about">
				<p class="about__text" i18n>Approximately 15% of the EU’s Gross Domestic Product is spent every year on procuring goods and services, and some estimates indicate that corruption increases the cost of government contracts by 20 - 25%. It is even more worrying that corruption in public procurement compromises widely supported public goals, such as building safe highways, high quality school buildings, or delivering medicine in time.</p>
				<p class="about__text" i18n>Providing comprehensive public procurement information free of charge in an easy-to-use format to all interested parties is expected to increase market transparency, decrease transaction costs, and facilitate government accountability. Hence, opentender.eu, a central, public, and open procurement platform has been set up to contribute to achieving value for money in public procurement as well as increase integrity throughout the public sector.</p>
