<!--				<p class="about__text" i18n>Around one-third of government expenditure is spent globally every year on procuring goods, works and services. Some estimates indicate that corruption increases the cost of government contracts by 20-25%. Corruption in public procurement also compromises widely supported public goals, such as building safe roads, high quality school buildings, or delivering medicine in time.</p>-->
<!--				<p class="about__text" i18n>Providing comprehensive public procurement information free of charge in an easy-to-use format to all interested parties is expected to increase market transparency, decrease transaction costs, and facilitate government accountability. Hence, opentender.eu, a central, public, and open procurement platform has been set up to contribute to achieving value for money in public procurement as well as increasing integrity throughout the public sector.</p>-->

					<accordion [title]="'Where does the data come from?'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The Jamaican public procurement database published on the Opentender Jamaica portal includes contract-level observations on implemented contracts of public bodies nationwide. Procuring entities are required to report their contracts to the Office of the Contractor General (OCG) by Quarterly Contract Award (QCA) Reports since May 1, 2006. Effective July 1, 2012, it is mandatory to publish all contracts with a value of J$500001 or higher. The dataset published on Opentender Jamaica covers the period between 2006 and 2018.

					<accordion [title]="'Improvement and standardization of geographic information in the dataset'">
						<p class="accordion__text">Showing regional level aggregated information requires location data, however, the original data source has only partially available and erroneous implementation addresses - for example, buyer name appearing instead of an address. To get exact and consistent addresses for all contracts, we gathered geographic information manually on all buyer entities using Google search. Based on the addresses, we were able to assign parish and county information to the contracts.</p>

					<accordion [title]="'Standardization of products and services'">
						<p class="accordion__text">In order to show market level aggregated information, we needed to classify products and services into groups. As the source data lacks information on product classification, we assigned CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) codes to tenders based on a list of keywords including the first 100 most frequent expressions product descriptions and an additional list of healthcare related words.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">CPV codes are 8 digit product codes, where the first 2 digits specify high-level divisions, such as ‘33-Medical equipment, pharmaceutical products’, the first 3 digits refer to groups, for example ‘331-Medical equipments’, the first 4 digits identify classes, for example:‘3316- Operating techniques’, and the first 5 digits indicate categories, for example ‘33161-Electrosurgical unit‘.

					<accordion [title]="'Classification of procedure types'">
						<p class="accordion__text">Public procurement procedure types are classified into high-level groups based on the level of competition they allow. In Jamaica, open tender, international and local competitive biddings were classified as open procedure, limited tenders as restricted procedure, electronic and simple direct tenders as outright awards, sole source and government to government procedures as other procurement methods.</p>
					</accordion>
				</div>
				<div class="about__flex-wrap">
					<accordion [title]="'Classification of buyer types'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The following buyer types were assigned to procuring entities by using a list of keywords (‘ministry’, ‘national’, ‘regional’, ‘university’, etc.), which appeared in the buyers’ name: national authority, national agency, public body, regional authority, regional agency and other.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">National authorities are at the central level of government. Organizations with regulatory power like ministries, national councils and commissions fall into this category. National agencies are separate legal entities with different levels of autonomy, independence and accountability, performing specific tasks nationwide. State companies, national funds, institutes are classified as national agencies. Public bodies, like ‘Bank of Jamaica’ are entities governed by public law. Regional and local authorities have limited decision making power, providing public services at regional or municipal level. Hospitals, universities, regional administrations are included in these categories. ‘Other’ category was assigned if the buyer name was available but could not be classified with the abovementioned method.</p>

					<accordion [title]="'Definition of Integrity Indicators'">
						<p class="accordion__text">The Integrity Indicator methodology is based on a corruption definition specific to public procurement, which refers to the allocation and performance of public contracts by distorting the principles of open and fair government contracting in order to benefit some to the detriment of all others. In other words, the aim of corruption is to avoid or distort competition in order to favour a certain, connected bidder.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">One way to measure this phenomenon is to consider the lack of bidders for government contracts (single-bidding) as an outcome, whereas, adverse tendering practices (for example, choosing non-open procedure types and shortening advertising period) as inputs of the low-integrity procurement process. The ‘red flags’, that are most likely to signal integrity risks, were identified in a statistical analysis. Tendering characteristics that had a significant and positive relationship with single-bidding are defined as red flags.</p>
						<p class="accordion__text">Integrity Indicator list in Jamaica:</p>
						<ul class="accordion__list">
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Single bidder contract</strong>: Single bidding is the simplest indication of restricted competition reflecting our corruption definition when only one bid is submitted for a tender on a competitive market (for further discussion of single bidding see Charron, Dahlström, Fazekas, & Lapuente, 2017). Sources: <a class="accordion__link" target="_blank" href="http://www.govtransparency.eu/index.php/2017/07/05/careers-connections-and-corruption-risks-investigating-the-impact-of-bureaucratic-meritocracy-on-public-procurement-processes/">http://www.govtransparency.eu/index.php/2017/07/05/careers-connections-and-corruption-risks-investigating-the-impact-of-bureaucratic-meritocracy-on-public-procurement-processes/</a></li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Call for tenders publication</strong>: Not publishing the call for tenders makes it less likely that potential bidders notice the bidding opportunity, weakening the competition and allowing the contracting bodies to more easily award contracts to a well-connected company.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Length of advertisement period</strong>: A short submission period, that is the number of days between publishing a tender and the submission deadline, leaves less time and thus makes it harder for non-connected companies to bid successfully. Well-connected suppliers can use their insider knowledge to place a bid in time as the buyer can informally inform the favoured bidder about the opportunity ahead of time.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Procedure type</strong>: Using procedure types that are less transparent and require less open competition can indicate the deliberate limitation of the range of bids received and to exclude bids as well as creating more opportunities for contracting bodies to repeatedly award contracts to the same well-connected supplier(s).</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Winner's contract share</strong>: Suppliers' share in a buyer's total spending can be used to measure the level of competitiveness and market openness. High supplier spending share, when a supplier or group of suppliers are awarded most procurement spending per buyer, can signal that a network has captured public contracting, potentially leading to higher prices, lower quality of work and value for money.</li>
							<li class="accordion__list-item"><strong>Number of requested bids</strong>: Similarly to number of received bids, higher number of requested bids can indicate more open and fair competition, while repeatedly low (0-2) numbers might be a sign that buyers favour a certain bidder who might be part of a corrupt network. Markets with only a limited number of bidders are exceptions.</li>
